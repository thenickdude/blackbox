This modified version of OpenLog 3 Lite discards the "config.txt" system that is normally
used to configure the OpenLog. Instead it hard-codes the correct settings for the Blackbox
(115200 baud).

You'll need to add the [required libraries][] to your Arduino IDE's library path in order to 
build this from source.
